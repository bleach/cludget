* Add a mode to simply emit the costs to stdout rather than graphing them.
* Move to an OO model so that adding costs for new providers doesn't involve 
  so much code duplication. We'd have classes for all the charging mechanisms 
  used.
* Build a basic webapp that has a form to input the key variables.
